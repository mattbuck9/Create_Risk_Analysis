# Create_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
### This project was to look to examine the credit risk of potential borrowers using supervised machine learning. 

## Results
### The accuracy of the first model, Naive Random Oversampling, was 64.13%. The accuracy of the second model, SMOTE Oversampling, was 62.44%. The accuracy of the third model, Undersampling, was 62.44%.The accuracy of the fourth model, Combination Sampling, was 52.93%. The accuracy of the fifth model, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, was 67.21%. The accuracy of the sixth model, Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier, was 91.98%.

### The precision and recall score of the models are as follows:
#### Naive Random Oversampling - 0.99 pre, 0.68 rec
#### SMOTE Oversampling - 0.99 pre, 0.55 rec
#### Undersampling - 0.99 pre, 0,45 rec
#### Combination Sampling - 0.99 pre, 0.45 rec
#### Balanced Random Forest Classifier - 1.00 pre, 1.00 rec
#### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier - 0.99 pre, 0.94 rec

## Summary
### As you can see, each machine learning model has its own efficacy and scores. The best one, based on the scores, would be the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost, as it has the highest accuracy as well as the second highest recall score. For that reason, my recommendation is to use the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost.
